# Frontend Architecture

## Core Decisions
- Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript
  - Server Components for performance
  - App Router for better routing
- TailwindCSS for rapid development
- React Query for data fetching/caching

## Key Implementation Choices
- Server-side pagination for large datasets
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Modal-based transaction forms
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Error boundaries for graceful failures

## Main Tradeoffs
- Local state vs global state management
  - Using React Query + local state only
  - Accepting some prop drilling for simplicity
- Server vs Client Components
  - Initial load: Server Components
  - Interactive features: Client-side
  - Balance between SEO and interactivity

## Critical Future Work
- Performance
  - Virtual scrolling
  - Bundle size optimization
  - Client-side search/filter

- UX/Security
  - Bulk operations
  - Enhanced mobile experience
  - Input sanitization
  - Session handling
  - Rate limiting

- Development
  - E2E tests
  - Error monitoring
  - Type definitions cleanup
